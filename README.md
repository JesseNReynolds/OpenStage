# OpenStage
##What?
A site that allows Users to form bands, and book those bands on avaialable gigs posted by Venues.
##Why?
I built this project as a learning experience and a demonstration of experience with Rails and Active Record.
##How?
You can check out the live hosted demo on [Heroku](https://openstage.herokuapp.com/). I periodically go in and clear out the database and revert to a default seeded state that uses mock data. If you have created an account and want me to clear the data immeditately, just send me an email (jessenreynoldsATgmailDOTCOM).
If you want to explore the project locally, you're welcome to do so, it shouldn't require any special setup if you have Ruby, Rails, and PostGreSQL configured on your system.

#Plans for the future
I have no plans to continue development on this app, it's just a demo. If you are interested in collaborating to make an app like this a reality, contact me at my email and we can discuss what that would look like.
